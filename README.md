# american-trail
A Twine survival game

**What is this?**

American Trail is a browser-based interactive game inspired by The Oregon Trail, except instead of dying of dysentery, you’re trying to survive:
	•	the modern American news cycle
	•	constant crisis
	•	misinformation
	•	burnout
	•	and the general feeling that something is always on fire

Built in Twine, this game uses dark humor and satire as a coping mechanism. Survival is not guaranteed. Neither is hope.

⸻

**Why does this exist?**

Because art is how some of us process reality.
Because humor is sometimes the only way to stay sane.
Because pretending everything is fine feels worse.

This project is not about being neutral. It’s about being honest.

**How to play**
	•	This game runs entirely in the browser.
	•	No downloads required.
	•	Click links. Make choices. Face consequences.
	•	If you die, that’s kind of the point.

(But also: try again.)

If this makes you laugh, feel seen, or momentarily less alone —
then it’s doing what it’s supposed to do.
